# xSixers for IPL Players

If you have ever watched a bit of English Premier League you 
might have seen their data zone where many stats such as total
distance run, pressure, shots on target, passes, and xG are shown. xG is
short for expected goals.

So this project aims to similarly find the xSixers of a batsman, xWickets
for a bowler in the IPL on the basis of various data available. 

## Data Viz

Some visualization tools are included to showcase the big picture of
the IPL cricket season like heatmaps, top 5 batsmen, bar and scatter
plots for all kinds of data.
